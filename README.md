# Learning Clojure with Immutant
A tutorial for learning the Clojure language through the creation of a web application for Immutant.


## Goals

The overall goal is to give the reader enough of an understanding of both Clojure and Immutant to build basic web
applications with confidence. It won't teach you everything about either ecosystem, but hopefully will provide the
necessary foundations. It is assume that the reader has a few years of programming experience with something like
Python or Ruby, but may not have a lot of experience with functional programming ideas. The ideas will be introduced
as needed with pointers to more in-depth material.

## Dependencies

* Clojure v1.6.0
* Leiningen v2.5.1
* Immutant v2.0.0beta2
* IntelliJ v14.1 Community Edition w/Cursive
